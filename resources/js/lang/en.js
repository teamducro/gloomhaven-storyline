He asked another favor of you in exchange for forgiveness for killing his brethren. The cultists want the necromancer, Jekserah, dead. If you bring her head to their headquarters, you may find out more about the “Gloom”. The figure gave you details on where to find evidence of Jekserah's plans.",

He then introduced you to a black, flaming rift in space that he called his master, “The Gloom”. The figure then promptly betrayed you by summoning a horde of unnatural creatures in an attempt to kill you. Apparently, getting back into the cult's good graces isn't easy after murdering their followers and setting back their plans. After an exhausting battle, the Gloom spoke to you in a cold, low voice. “You have done well. My minions may not be able to forgive. But I can. Come. Come to me. Step into my realm. Embrace the inevitable.” The rift stands before you. Do you dare enter?",

You will rot here, completely cut off from your home. There will be no last stand. You will simply waste away. You will die without valor in a foreign place and there is no recourse. I leave you now forever. Good-bye.” The ensuing battle seemed endless. After killing everything, you banged on the walls, desperately hoping for something to continue fighting against in this exile. You grew tired, then your vision darkened. In your next breath, you found yourself laying in the grass outside of the cult’s hideout. “Know that I have spared you.” The low voice returned. “Your persistence intrigues me. I invite you to break yourself against me. It will be more entertaining than the last time I brought gloom to this world.” You bolted upright and rushed back into the crypt. Dead bodies of the cultists littered the floor. “I am not here anymore. These shells have served their purpose. My roots are now deep and you will soon encounter my endless power once more. I look forward to the day.”"

There is a diamond mine in the southern mountains overrun by Vermlings, with some other more intelligent force behind them. If you can fight your way in and grab the biggest diamond you can find, Jekserah will give you a considerable reward. However, you have been also been warned by a guard that Jekserah may have more sinister machinations than she lets on. Something about overthrowing the military... but one diamond couldn't hurt, could it?",

They were lead by a Merciless Overseer who swiftly turned the miners against you with a few cracks of his whip. Once the overseer was dealt with and the diamond recovered, the remaining miners scattered. You headed back to Jekserah to claim your reward. Her bodyguards escorted you inside the manor where you found her somehow different—more harrowed and grim. “Wonderful.” She exchanged the diamond for a large purse full of coins. “This will serve beautifully as a focus for the incantations. I wonder if the cultists even knew what they had here. With this, I can summon an entire army of undead!” She turned to you with a strange glint in her eye. “So then! Are you ready to overthrow the military of Gloomhaven and put control of the city into the hands of the Merchant’s Guild? Or do you not have the stomach to effect real change?”",

You raided Jekserah's warehouse and uncovered her secret plans to invade the town with an army of the dead. In the process, she fled the city.

Luckily, Inox don’t feel a particular need to cover their tracks. You are able to follow their trail deeper into the woods, where eventually you find a slave labor camp. Inox guards overseeing a group of ragged Orchids and humans working to construct catapults and other machines of war.

Whatever creatures haunt these shadows, I cannot help you fight them, but if you survive, I will show you the way back.” As Redthorn disappears into the mist, you begin to see other forms moving at the edge of your vision. And then you hear the hoofbeats, like a terrible thunder rolling through the trees. The sound gets closer and closer until the ground beneath your feet tremors at the approach. The headless spectre screams as you land one final strike against it, and its form begins to dissipate, black wisps of smoke escaping from the cracks in its armor. Redthorn appears out of the thinning fog. “I don’t know how you did it, but I can already feel the forest lighten.

All that awaits you is the embrace of death.” You ready your weapons. You can hardly see through the blizzard, but you are determined to make sure death embraces someone else. As quickly as you can, you escape the rising storm of ice to find some semblance of shelter in a cave. Upon seeing a glowing white orb behind the crytalline demons, the pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking your passage to the peak. After destroying the orb, pieces fall to the snowy floor along with the corpses of the enemies who stood in your way. The screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak. At this altitude, without a cloud in sight, you find yourself looking out over the horizon, marveling at the wondrous expanse of mountains and the forests and plains beyond them. You can even see the faint outline of Gloomhaven in the distance.",

You are very close to the peak now, and you surmise that this development has something to do with the evil presence at the summit. You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you. “You dare approach my nest?” You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. “I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!” After battling the demon it screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."

I used it to imprison one of my greatest foes—a being of death and hatred. I do not know what will happen when you bring that thing to my chamber, but I can guarantee you no good will come of it!” You block the Voice’s lies from your mind and venture into the cave. You make your way to the Echo Chamber, and, before the Voice can speak another word, you raise up the scepter and channel its power. A black fog oozes from it and envelops you. The Voice screams out once more, but there is no coherence in the sound—only pain. The fog begins to dissipate and, for a moment, you feel relief, until you see that you are not in the Echo Chamber anymore, but some dark and hostile realm instead. The Voice rings out again, but somehow it is different: “The power of the Voice is mine! You will be the first I destroy with it!” A strong note of dissonance rings out as you snap the last chord, and then there is silence."

We’ve spent all our resources constructing a cannon capable of punching through Gloomhaven’s walls, but once that is accomplished, we don’t have the numbers or arms necessary to engage the demon force and drive them out of our home.” The captain unfurls a map of the city onto a table. “But you could be our secret weapon.

You decide a two-pronged assault will be the best way to get your hands on the weapon caches quickly. You hear the distant explosion of the cannon and spring into action. You secure the last of the armory stock just as the rebel fighters break through into the fortress. Cleaning out the demons from the rest of the building becomes short work after that. With a strong foothold in the town and the populace on your side, the tide quickly turns against the demons. The battle is still long and difficult, as more forces continue to arrive from the elemental plane, but it ultimately only brings the residents of Gloomhaven into stronger unison, fighting against a common enemy. And with you no longer fighting for them, the demon force eventually relents and retreats back to its own plane. The next weeks are difficult, as the citizenry rebuilds the walls and everything else that had been destroyed in the prolonged battle. They also need time to trust you again after your ill-conceived betrayal. But Gloomhaven does bounce back in time. It is full of resilient people and the port is vital for trade.

You must find him there and stop him from returning this world to ash.” As you approach the black column, it becomes clear that it is not smoke but a whirlwind of black sand extending far into the sky. The tremors continue, but you race towards the vortex as quickly as you can. The pouch fills you with a dull numbness. “Those brave enough to enter here will be the first torn apart.” An arresting voice echoes through the chamber around you. “The rest I will hunt down like game and devour, but I do think I will enjoy this more.” As your eyes adjust to the low light, you see a shadowy form in the center of the room. With time, you are able to focus on the image of an Aesther with two long, thin blades. “I have waited many years to reap this harvest,” he says with a wicked grin. “At one time, I had convinced myself that I would find more delight in watching you slowly kill yourselves, but with my meddling brethren and the deaths of my wards, I have returned to my original design. “I am not unhappy at the development. Even the patience of an immortal has its limits.” The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance. “Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?” Two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face. “How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?” The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings. “You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!” At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence. The dull pain subsides, and you ascend the staircase to a bright, clear sky. The tremors and vortex of black sand are gone and all those gathered around the Void look very relieved when you emerge from the confrontation.

You just know something is wrong with them. As all of this wasn't enough, your wounds appear to heal mysteriously slower than normal. Everything feels odd and wrong, both in your body and in your spirit, and you feel both scarred by the enemies weapons and by the nightmares haunting you. Maybe drinking and gambling will finally heal you? You come back to the Sleeping Lion, where you are treated like heroes.

She appears to know a lot about it, and mentions that the Void was once the site of a great tower that Bastian built to house researchers and studies. When the Gloom started his evil doings, the Tower and all its inhabitants were scattered all across the infinite beyond: that was the beginning of the Aesther race, mutated by the long exodus they were forced. She introduces herself as Cassandra, a travellers through realities. She tried to stop the Gloom centuries ago, but she sadly failed and has been a prisoner even since, doomed to watch the Gloom plans unfold helplessly. Cassandra asks for our help: to stop the Gloom once and for all she first needs to go to the Void and find the vast library of Bastian texts, once part of the Tower. Vigil cultists will try to stop her, but that's your problem to solve, after all."

You immediately rush there to save your friend. When you reach the Crooked Bone, Cassandra is unable to teleport you inside. You run through the door and reach for Hail, explaining the situation, but she percieve is too late, the creatures are already there. She tells you to get to her storage closet and you make way.",

The creature are now defeated, and it also seems that this deactivated the anti-rift protection Hail had in her house, because now Cassandra opens a rift and you head back to a safe place. It seems that Cassandra knew about this impending attack and used Hail as some sort of bait to destroy the agents of Corruption. The final fight is now right ahead of you."

Cassandra begins her ritual and finds the hideout where whoever is orchestrating this hides. She shields you from the corruption via some magic protections, but recognize the power you are about to face is bigger than hersThe primary objective is to subdue the corruption and avert its escape, separating the battle zone from the interdimentional void. She teleports you all to a blackened landscape, where weird apparitions pulsate in a blue light. Everything is evershifting, even the floor beneath you, looking like a mess of floating rocks.You feel the presence of a dark energy, and a corruption mass grows in the middle of your group. It claws at your mind, try to bend you will, but you manage to fight back. Just when you are about to attack it, the mass screams and invoke its army, made of corrupted Aesthers and Valrath. It then proceeds to splay its tendrils in every direction, pulling back crystal shards that it feeds onto. It seems to gather energy from the infinite realms, and as every second passes it grows stronger and stronger. It is time to act!",

Cassandra conjures a net of glowing cables, chaining it: the corruption still fights back, but its power is not enough and, after a bit, it stops.Just when you are about to rest, everything around you starts cracking and crumbling; you jump back to the last portal still open and hurry back in Gloomhaven. When you open again your eyes, you find yourself back at the Sleeping Lion. Like nothing happens, you order a round of drinks and finally sit. Your mission is complete. Cassandra thanks you all, but it is time to part ways. Someone else is waiting for her. “Enjoy your drink”, she says as she steps through a rift. You definitely deserve it."
