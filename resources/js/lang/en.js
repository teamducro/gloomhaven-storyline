I invite you to break yourself against me. It will be more entertaining than the last time I brought gloom to this world.\" You bolted upright and rushed back into the crypt. Dead bodies of the cultists littered the floor. \"I am not here anymore. These shells have served their purpose. My roots are now deep and you will soon encounter my endless power once more. I look forward to the day.\""

It was difficult to notice at first, but, over time, a faint tremor in the floor and walls began to grow until it was difficult to even keep your footing. Then there was a flash of light, and before you floated a swirling green mist in the shape of many long, intertwined tendrils. “I had almost forgotten what it felt like to not be imprisoned.” For once you heard the Voice not from inside your own head, but emanating from the figure in front of you. “It is quite wondrous. I am sure that before too long, I will forget the horrid feeling of powerlessness. It is time to leave this realm,” the Voice said. “There is much to be remedied from my prolonged absence. But first, I must give you a proper thanks. I shall hold up my end of the bargain and bestow upon you great power and wealth.” The green light spreads forth and illuminated you, providing you with the most wonderful feeling of warmth. And then it was gone. All that was left was a stone tablet in the center of the room with strange, cryptic markings. Perhaps those marking may be useful in the future.",

The Dark Rider fades into and out of the mist seemingly at random.

Redthorn appears out of the thinning fog. “I don’t know how you did it, but I can already feel the forest lighten.

A sharp screeching rings out, and you crouch down squinting through the darkness. Near the peak you see many dark shapes scrabbling and writhing, as if the mountain itself is alive. Squinting further, you notice that the writhing is moving down the mountain toward you. It seems your presence has not gone unnoticed. You ready your weapons and prepare to fight your way to the peak. You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you. “You dare approach my nest?” You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. “I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!” You battle the demon and its 'children' until finally, the demon can take no more. The giant demon screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."

If you bring the scepter to the Voice's chamber, you can renew the binding and silence this damned voice once and for all.{br}As you stood in the mountain cave, scepter in hand, the Voice called to you. “Your intentions are noble. You fear me and wish to keep me imprisoned. I understand, but what you are doing will only lead to disaster and ruin. That scepter was not created to strengthen my prison. I created it! I used it to imprison one of my greatest foes—a being of death and hatred. I do not know what will happen when you bring that thing to my chamber, but I can guarantee you no good will come of it!” Shut up shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP! You blocked the Voice’s lies from your mind and before the Voice could speak another word, you raised up the scepter and channeled its power. A black fog oozed from it and enveloped you. The Voice screamed out once more, but there was no coherence in the sound—only pain. The fog began to dissipate and, for a moment, you felt relief, until you saw that you were not in the Echo Chamber anymore, but some dark and hostile realm instead. The Voice rang out again, but somehow it was different: “The power of the Voice is mine! You will be the first I destroy with it!” And try it did, but after a fierce battle, you severed the Voice's vocal chords. The Voice will never speak again."

The last battalion of guards hesitates as it faces you, then the humans turn and flee. “Arm the siege weapon!” One of them calls as they crest the hill. You give chase. This should be interesting. Fighting through the first wave of soldiers, you arrive at a clearing. The rest of the guards are standing around a very large mechanical cannon. The guards fire the cannon at you many times, but you endure the volleys and slay the guards as you advance. Eventually, the cannon lies ruined and broken at your feet, and with it, any hope the rebels had of assaulting Gloomhaven. The guards who are still alive scatter, and you return to the demon-ruled Gloomhaven victorious. “So you have crushed the pathetic upstarts?” You stand before one of the Prime Demon’s liaisons. “Good. You have proven yourselves an incredibly effective tool, and my master will compensate you greatly for your service.”"

Working for a Demon hasn't been all it was cracked up to be. It might just be time to join the rebel alliance.{br}You follow the dead guard’s directions into the foothills of the Watcher Mountains. Not to kill and destroy, but to help. The rebels seem wary at first, but they eventually open up. \"You could be our secret weapon. If you could take the armory of the Ghost Fortress just as we break through the north wall, we could then converge at the fortress and make our stand there. Once we are properly armed and have you at our side, the demons won’t stand a chance. Most of the citizenry are unhappy under their occupation and will rise up when they see we have the advantage.” Three days later you sneak into the Ghost Fortress, and storm the armory. You secure the last of the armory stock just as the rebel fighters break through into the fortress. Cleaning out the demons from the rest of the building becomes short work after that. With a strong foothold in the town and the populace on your side, the tide quickly turns against the demons. The battle is still long and difficult, as more forces continue to arrive from the elemental plane, but it ultimately only brings the residents of Gloomhaven into stronger unison, fighting against a common enemy. And with you no longer fighting for them, the demon force eventually relents and retreats back to its own plane. The next weeks are difficult, as the citizenry rebuilds the walls and everything else that had been destroyed in the prolonged battle. They also need time to trust you again after your ill-conceived betrayal. But Gloomhaven does bounce back in time. It is full of resilient people and the port is vital for trade. It never feels quite the same afterward, but at some point, it at least still feels like home."

Hail resolutely points you toward the whirling mass of sand, handing you a pouch to protect you from its ill effects. Entering the vortex is immensely painful but the pouch fills you with a dull numbness. Eventually, you find yourself standing in a large stone room covered in odd runic symbols. There is an unearthly coldness to it, and the dull pain of the Void persists. “Those brave enough to enter here will be the first torn apart.” An arresting voice echoes through the chamber around you. “The rest I will hunt down like game and devour, but I do think I will enjoy this more.” As your eyes adjust to the low light, you see a shadowy form in the center of the room. With time, you are able to focus on the image of an Aesther with two long, thin blades. “I have waited many years to reap this harvest,” he says with a wicked grin. “At one time, I had convinced myself that I would find more delight in watching you slowly kill yourselves, but with my meddling brethren and the deaths of my wards, I have returned to my original design. “I am not unhappy at the development. Even the patience of an immortal has its limits.” The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance. “Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?” The battle rages for what feels like eons, but finally, two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face. “How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?” The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings. “You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!” At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence. The dull pain subsides, and you ascend the staircase to a bright, clear sky. The tremors and vortex of black sand are gone and all those gathered around the Void look very relieved when you emerge from the confrontation. You let the people know that whatever calamity had descended upon them has now been averted. They cheer and celebrate your strength."
